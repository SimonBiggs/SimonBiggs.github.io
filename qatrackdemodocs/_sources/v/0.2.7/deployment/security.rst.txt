Notes on Security
=================

Generally the `example deployment options <about.html>`__ are configured
using http connections rather than https connections and it is important
to consider the security implications of this.

QATrack+ requires users to login to the system with a username and
password. Since http requests are not secure the username & password are
transmitted over the wire in clear text making them susceptible to
`sniffing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer>`__. QATrack+ is
generally meant to run on secure intranets (e.g. everyone with access to
the network is "trusted") so this may or may not be a concern for you.

If you are worried about password sniffing or other attacks, your server
can be set up either to use encrypted connections using the https
protocol or using `Single Sign On & Integrated
Authentication <windows/iisFastCGI.html>`__. This is especially important
if your site is exposed to external networks (e.g. the internet).

Please discuss these issues with your IT team!

Using https connections
-----------------------

Using https connections requires you to have an SSL certificate
installed on your server. The exact implementation of this is left up to
the person deploying your QATrack+ installation, but I am happy to give
advice if I can on the `QATrack+ google
group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/qatrack>`__.

SSL certificates can either be purchased from a commercial provider, or
you can create self-signed certificates using `Windows
Server <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753127(v=ws.10).aspx>`__
or
`OpenSSL <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-build-a-self-signed-certificate-with-openssl>`__
on Linux (Mac?).

The simplest approach to using https is to have QATrack+ running on a
WSGI server (Apache/ModWSGI, CherryPy, gunicorn, uwsgi etc) behind a
reverse proxy (e.g. nginx, IIS, Apache) where your reverse proxy only
accepts https connections and then forwards those requests as http to
your WSGI server. This forces the decryption to happen in your reverse
proxy and QATrack+ then does not need to concern itself with https
itself. This is shown conceptually below.
