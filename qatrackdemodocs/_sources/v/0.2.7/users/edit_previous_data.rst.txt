Editing Previously Entered Data
===============================

If your user group has the required permissions, you may edit previously
completed data. To edit a specific test list instance, first navigate to
the `history of the test list <view_history.html>`__ of the test list and
click on the **Edit** button of the session that you want to revise.

You can then edit the previous results and save as usual. Note that when
you edit a test list instance the default behaviour is to reset the
status for all the tests to the default test status. For example, if a
qa session had already been reviewed but was later edited and saved, it
will show up in your **Unreviewed** list again (assuming your default
status is one which requires review).
