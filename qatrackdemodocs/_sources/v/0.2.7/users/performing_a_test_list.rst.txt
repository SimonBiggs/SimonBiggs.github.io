On the next page, all the test lists with the chosen frequency will be
displayed along with relevant information about the last time that test

Performing a test list
----------------------

An example test list is shown below. Details about all the features will
given below but briefly, you can see all the tests completed and ready
to be submitted. The shaded input boxes for the last two tests indicate
that they are `composite tests <../admin/tests.html>`__ i.e. they are test
values calculated based on the other 4 input values. Passing, tolerance
and failing tests are displayed with a green, yellow or red status,
respectively. Tests which have no reference or tolerance set for them
are shown in blue.

test list.

Skipping a test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Occasionally it may be required to skip a test when performing a test
list. To accomplish this, check off the **skip** checkbox next to the
test and add a comment (required) explaining why you are skipping the
test.

Performing a subset of a test list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some test lists may have tests from more than one `category
type <../admin/categories.html>`__. To selectively perform the tests from
one or more categories, use the select box at the top of the list to
choose the test categories you want to perform. Tests from categories
that are not selected, will be hidden and marked as skipped with a
comment explaining why.

Saving a test list to complete it later
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If for some reason you need to finish a test list at a later time, you
can click the **Mark this list as still in progress** checkbox next to
the **Submit QA Results** button. When this box is checked, the test
list will not be considered complete and will not be marked for review.
