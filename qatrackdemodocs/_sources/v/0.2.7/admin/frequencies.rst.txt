Test List Frequencies
=====================

When a `test list is assigned to a unit <assign_to_unit.html>`__ you give
it a frequency with which it should be performed. This frequency
determines when a test list is show as being due/overdue on a unit.

Frequencies can be configured from the main admin page by clicking on
the **Frequencis** link in the **QA** section.

Example configurations are shown below for **Daily** and **Monthly**
frequencies.

QATrack+ uses an "offset" system for deciding whether a test list is not
due, due or overdue. If it has been less than *due interval* days since
the last time a test list was performed the due date will be shown in
green.

When a test list reaches its due date it will be shown in yellow.

Finally if a test list has not been completed within the *overdue
interval* number of days it will be shown in red.
