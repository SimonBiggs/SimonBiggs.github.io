A step-by-step introduction to QATrack+ administration (continued)

`(Previous Page) <test_list_start_to_finish_4.html>`__

In this part of the tutorial we will create a test list made up of the 6
tests we defined in the previous part of this tutorial.

Creating the test list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create the test list, visit the **Test Lists** link under the **QA**
section from the main admin page and then click on **Add test list** in
the top right hand corner.

Give the test list the name *Machine Output* and slug *machine-output*.
We will ignore the description and sublist fields for now.

Under the **Test list memberships** section click on green cross/\ *Add
another Test list membership* link at the bottom to make a 6th text box
appear. Now click the first magnifying glass and click on the
*Temperature* test in the window that pops up.

Repeat this step for the other 5 tests we defined at which point the
*Test list memberships* section should look like:

   Test list memberships

If you now click **Save and continue editing** the memberships section
should show the actual tets names (and macro names):

That's it! Now that we've created our tests and test list we can assign
it to the `unit we created earlier <test_list_start_to_finish_2.html>`__.
This is covered in the `next step of this
tutorial <test_list_start_to_finish_6.html>`__.
