   Adding a new unit

Enter ``1`` for the **Number** and ``Test Unit`` for the **Name** field.
We will leave the **Serial Number**, **Location** and **Install date**
blank for now. You will notice that the **Type** dropdown is empty since
we haven't defined any unit types yet.

Clicking on the green cross beside **Type** will bring up a dialogue box
where we can create a new type of unit. Fill in ``Synergy S``,
``Elekta``, and ``Synergy S`` for the **Name** (i.e. the display name
for this unit type), **Vendor** and **Model** fields respectively and
then click **Save**.

   Defining a new unit type

Since there are no modalities yet defined, we will need to add some
before we can save our unit.

Click the little green cross beside the **Modalities** input and in the
dialogue box that pops up, choose the ``Photon`` modality type, and
enter ``6`` in the **Energy** input before clicking **Save**. Repeat
these steps to add a 15MV modality as well.

You are now finished configuring your first unit and it should look
similar to the image below:

Clicking **Save** will take you back to the units listing page where you
should see your ``Test Unit`` listed.

If you need to edit this unit in future, navigate to this page and click
on the name of the unit you want to edit.

In the `next step of the tutorial <test_list_start_to_finish_3.html>`__ we
will create a new user group and a couple fo test statuses.
