Creating a new user group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Return to the main admin page and click on the **Groups** link under the
**Auth** section and then click the **Add group** button in the top
right.

Set the **Name** field to ``Physics`` and choose the following set of
permissions:

-  **qa \| frequency \| Choose QA by Frequency**
-  **qa \| test instance \| Can review tests**
-  **qa \| test instance \| Can chart test history**
-  **qa \| test instance \| Can view test history**
-  **qa \| test instance \| Can skip without comment**
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can add test list instance**
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can perform subset of tests**
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can view previously completed
   instances**
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can change test list instance**
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can override date**
-  **qa \| unit test info \| Can view Refs and Tols**

Your group should look like the following:

The last step is to add yourself to the ``Physics`` group. Visit your
user profile by going to the **Users** section under the **Auth**
section and clicking on your username.

Click on **Save** to finalize the addition of yourself to the *Physics*
group.

Creating test statuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are going to create two test statuses; first an ``Unreviewed`` status
which will be the default status given to test data when they are
performed and second an ``Approved`` status that can be applied to the
tests after they have been reviewed.

From the main admin page click on the **Statuses** link under the **QA**
section and click the **Add test instance status** button in the top
right.

Give the status a **Name** of ``Unreviewed``, a **Slug** of
``unreviewed`` and a description of
``Default status for tests which have just been completed.``. Next,
check off the **Is default** checkbox and then click **Save and add
another**.

.. figure:: unreviewed.png

Create an ``Approved`` status similar to the ``Unreviewed`` status but
this time leave the **Is default** box unchecked and also uncheck the
**Requires review** checkbox. Click **Save** when you're finished.

You should now see your two statuses in the listing.

Now that we have done the initial configuration we can begin to cover
test and test list configuration. This is covered in the `next step of
the tutorial <test_list_start_to_finish_4.html>`__.
