Configuring Test List Cycles
============================

A **test list cycle** allows you to group multiple `test
lists <test_lists.html>`__ into a single repeating cycle that can be
assigned to a unit.

For example, at our clinic, on a number of units, the therapists daily
QA is on a repeating 2 or 4 day cycle where the actual tests they
perform vary slightly by day. A test list cycle allows us to handle this
situation without the therapists having to keep track of which day was
done last.

For a 4 day cycle, you would create 4 separate test lists (e.g. Morning
Outputs Day 1, Morning Outputs Day 2, Morning Outputs Day 3, Morning
Outputs Day 4) and then create a Test List Cycle made up of those 4 Test
Lists. You would then assign that Test List Cycle to the unit with a
daily frequency, rather than assigning each of the 4 test lists
individually.

When a user performs a Test List Cycle, it checks which test list in the
cycle was performed last and automatically presents them with the tests
in the next days test list. So if Day 2 was performed yesterday, they
will be presented with the Day 3 tests today. You can also manually
override which day you want to perform.

Defining a test list cycle is described below.
