Managing Users and Groups
=========================

Access to various QATrack+ features for users is defined based on which
groups a user belongs to and which permissions have been assigned to
their groups, or them specifically.

User Groups
-----------

User groups are useful for managing the permissions of many users at
once. For example, you may have groups for Administrators, Physicists,
Physics Technologists and Therapists (A user may belong to one or more
groups) each with different permissions and different parts of QATrack+
accessible to them.

To define a new user group click on the *Groups* link from the main
admin page and then click **Add group** on the top right hand corner of
the next page. Give your group a name and then choose the permissions
available to that group (permissions are described in more detail
below). Once you are finished, click **Save**.

Users
-----

If you are using Active Directory for user authentication then new users
will be automatically created the first time they log in. Otherwise if
you are using the built in authentication system you will need to create
users manually.

Creating a new user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the main admin page click on the **Users** link under the **Auth**
section and then click **Add user**. On the next page fill out the
username and password fields. (The user will be able to change their
password to something different on their own later). Click **Save** when
you are finished.

On the next page you can fill out more details about the users including
proper names, which groups the user belongs to and any permissions
specific to that person (i.e. that are not already covered by the groups
they are members of).

Any user that has **Staff Status** checked on their user profile page
will have access to the admin site.

A user with **Superuser status** checked will have all permissions
granted to them without needing to explicitly specified.

Permissions
-----------

The easiest method of managing permissions is to grant specific
permissions to a group and then make users part of that group. The user
will inherit all the permissions of their groups and as such do not need
to have them explicitly granted to them on their user profile page (that
is, you can leave the **Chosen user permissions** box blank on most
users profile page).

You will likely want to tweak the set of permissions your user groups
are granted but example permission sets are given below to help you get
started.

The most important permissions are described here and typical permission
sets for groups are given below:.

-  **qa \| test instance \| Can view test history** *Allows a user to
   view historical data alongside a test when performing a test list.*
-  **qa \| test instance \| Can view charts of test history** *Allows a
   user to plot charts of historical data*
-  **qa \| test instance \| Can review tests** *Allow a user to perform
   review & approval functions*
-  **qa \| test instance \| Can review & approve self-performed tests**
   *Allow a user to review their own test results (requires review
   permission as well)*
-  **qa \| test instance \| Can skip without comment** *Allows a user to
   skip tests without adding a comment*
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can add test list instance** *Required
   for all users who will be performing QA*
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can perform subset of tests** *Allows a
   user to perform only a subset of test categories when performing a
   test list*
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can view previously completed
   instances** *Allows a user to view (but not edit) previously
   completed test lists*
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can change test list instance** *Allows
   a user to edit previously completed test results*
-  **qa \| frequency \| Choose QA by Frequency** *Allows a user to
   access different frequencies of QA to perform*
-  **qa \| test list instance \| Can override date** *Enables a user to
   override the default date and time for a test list instance*
-  **qa \| unit test info \| Can view Refs and Tols** *Enables the
   display of reference and tolerance values when a user is performing a
   test list*
-  **qa \| unit test collection \| Can view program overview** *Allows a
   user to view the program overview page*
-  **qa \| unit test collection \| Can view TLI and UTC not visible to
   user's groups** *Allows a user to view all Test Lists regardless of
   their groups *

Minimal set of permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A fairly minimal set of permissions for performing QA (e.g. for a
therapist) is:

-  qa \| test list instance \| Can add test list instance
-  qa \| test list instance \| Can perform subset of tests (optional)
-  qa \| test list instance \| Can view previously completed instances
   (optional)

This set of permissions will allow a user to access and perform daily &
weekly QA and optionally view previously comleted test lists.

Permissions for performing and viewing test history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For users who will be performing lots of QA but will not be reviewing
and approving data or configuring new tests and test lists (e.g. a
Physics Technologist), the list of permissions might look like the
following:

-  qa \| frequency \| Choose QA by Frequency
-  qa \| test instance \| Can chart test history
-  qa \| test instance \| Can view test history
-  qa \| test list instance \| Can add test list instance
-  qa \| test list instance \| Can override date
-  qa \| test list instance \| Can perform subset of tests
-  qa \| test list instance \| Can view previously completed instances
-  qa \| test list instance \| Can change test list instance
-  qa \| unit test info \| Can view Refs and Tols
