Contributing to the QATrack+ Development
========================================

We would certainly welcome contributions of code or
cleanups/refactorings of existing code from anyone who is interested in
helping out.

This page will get filled out with more details as time goes on, but if
you're interested in hacking on the QATrack+ code please `fork the
QATrack+ repository on
bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus>`__.

Please feel free to `edit this page <../edit/developers/about/>`__ and
add any details you think will be helpful to other people!

Getting ahold of the source code
--------------------------------

The general sequence to contribute/patch source code to QATrack+ is as
follows:

-  `Install git <#install_git>`__
-  Create a `Bitbucket
   account <https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/>`__
-  `Fork the QATrack+
   respository <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Fork+a+Repo%2C+Compare+Code%2C+and+Create+a+Pull+Request>`__
   found `here <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/>`__
-  `Clone your newly forked
   repository <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Clone+Your+Git+Repo+and+Add+Source+Files>`__
   to your local computer.
-  Add a new feature, clean up some code, add tests etc
-  Push your changes back to your repository
-  `Create a pull request for the main TOHCC
   repository <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Fork+a+Repo%2C+Compare+Code%2C+and+Create+a+Pull+Request>`__

Installing git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QATrack+ uses `git <http://git-scm.com/>`__ for revision control
purposes. If you're new to git, Bitbucket has a tutorials for
installing/configuring git on
`Windows <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+Git+and+Mercurial>`__,
and `Mac
OSX <https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=269981802>`__
(ignore the Mercurial/HG sections)...if you're on a Linux system, git
should be available via your package manager (e.g. apt-get install git,
yum install git-core etc.).
