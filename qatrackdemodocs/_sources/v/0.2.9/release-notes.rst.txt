v0.2.9 Release Notes
--------------------

-  Multiple choices tests now store their results `as the test value
   rather than the
   index <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/162/adding-new-multiple-choice-options-can>`__
   of the choice. It is important that you update any composite tests
   that rely on multiple choice test results after this upgrade (see
   Upgrade Instructions below)
-  Unit modalities `are now free text
   fields <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/110/change-unit-modality-to-free-text-field>`__
   instead of forcing you to select particle/energy.
-  If you attempt to access a QATrack+ page but are logged out, `you
   will be redirected to that page after logging
   in <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/154/redirect-after-login>`__
-  You can now add ``REVIEW_DIFF_COL = True`` to your
   `local\_settings.py <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/wiki/v/0.2.9/deployment/settings.html>`__
   file to `enable an extra column showing the difference from
   reference <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/155/add-deviation-from-reference-to-testlist>`__
   when reviewing tests list
-  Users sessions will be `renewed anytime they are
   active <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/165/refresh-session-after-any-activity-rather>`__
   on the QATrack+ site rather than just when they perform QA (prevents
   being logged out automatically)
-  Changing a Test's type is now limited to `only allow changes to
   similar test
   types <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/168/changes-between-test-types-needs-to-be>`__
   (e.g. numerical -> composite is allowed but numerical -> string is
   not)
-  By default `inactive test lists are no longer
   shown <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/170/add-filter-to-not-display-by-default>`__
   in the default review list
-  Bulk deletion of UnitTestInfo objects in the admin `has been
   disabled <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/171/disable-bulk-delete-of-unittestinfo>`__
   to prevent possible data loss
-  Only active UnitTestInfo objects will be `shown in the
   admin <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/172/make-unittestinfo-list-in-admin-only-show>`__

   comments <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/175/view-comments>`__
   in a pop over by hovering your mouse over the comment icon
-  You can now filter Test objects in the admin by whether or not `they
   belong to any active
   TestList's <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/177/test-search>`__
   or not
-  If a comment is included when performing a test list than `manual
   review will be
   required <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/179/auto-review-exception-for-tests-with>`__
   regardless of auto-review settings
-  Inactive tests can now be `filtered on the charts
   page <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/183/filter-out-inactive-tests-in-the-chart>`__
-  Several charting tweaks, including improved handling of None
   tolerance values in relative charts and the ability to filter for
   inactive TestLists
-  There are many new filters available in the admin section
-  Permissions for reviewing and viewing the program overview `have been
   split <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/194/separate-permisssions-for-review-and>`__

   without a
   comment <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/195/skipping-without-comment-for-some-but-not>`__
   (regardless of the users permissions)
-  You can now `set a custom
   label <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/198/allow-customization-of-testlist-cycle-drop>`__
   for the "Choose Day" drop down label when performing a test list from
   a cycle.
-  You can now `customize the names for Tolerance
   labels <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/wiki/v/0.2.9/deployment/settings.html>`__
   (Not Done, OK, Tolerance, Action, and No Tol Set).
-  You can now sort test lists by due date
-  You can now `customize the test status
   display <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/200/tolerance-action-level-naming>`__
   (default remains Act/Tol/OK)
-  Test value input fields should now be more `mobile device
   friendly <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/210/change-text-input-type-to-number-for>`__
-  pydicom is now available in the `default calculation
   context <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/219/add-pydicom-to-default-calculation-context>`__
   (along with numpy & scipy)
-  You can now filter test lists to review `by which groups the test
   lists are visible
   to <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/227/visible-to>`__

the issues
tracker <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues?milestone=0.2.9>`__!

Deprecation Notices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As QATrack+, Python & Django and the web continue to evolve,
occassionally we need to deprecate some of the versions of Python & web
browsers we support. The next major release of QATrack+ will no longer
officially support the following items:

-  Python 2.6 (Python 2.7 & 3.4+ only): In order to provide support for
   Python 3 we will be dropping support for Python 2.6
-  IE7-IE10 (IE 11+ Only): IE7-IE10 are no longer supported by Microsoft
   and we will no longer be testing these platforms.

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

If you are uncomfortable with doing the upgrade yourself, or would like
assistance for any reason, please email randle.taylor@gmail.com and I
will be more than happy to set up a time to be on call to help you
troubleshoot or to do a remote support session and walk through the
upgrade process with you. It is much easier for me to schedule time to
help you before you start your upgrade, then it is to drop everything
without warning and help you if get stuck on one of these steps!

::

    Note: this release introduces some database schema changes. The database migrations have
    been tested on SQLServer, PostgreSQL, MySQL & SQLite but it is important that you:

    BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS UPGRADE

**If any of the following steps results in an error, stop and figure out
why before carrying on to the next step!**

Linux/Apache Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Back up your database
2.  ``source ~/venvs/qatrack/bin/activate``
3.  ``cd ~/web/qatrackplus``
4.  ``git rm --cached qatrack/wsgi.py``
5.  ``git pull origin master``
6.  ``pip install --upgrade pip``
7.  ``pip install -r requirements/base.txt``
8.  ``python manage.py syncdb``
9.  ``python manage.py migrate``
10. ``python manage.py collectstatic``
11. Open your qatrack/local\_settings.py file and add the line:
    ``ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_servername_or_ip_here']`` e.g.
    ``ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['52.123.4.9']`` or
    ``ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['YOURHOSTNAME']``
12. ``sudo service apache2 restart``

Windows / IIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Back up your database
2.  Open a git bash shell
3.  export WINPTY=$(which winpty)
4.  ``source /c/deploy/venvs/qatrack/Scripts/activate``
5.  ``cd /c/deploy/qatrackplus``
6.  ``git rm --cached qatrack/wsgi.py``
7.  ``git pull origin master``
8.  ``pip install --upgrade pip``
9.  ``pip install -r requirements/base.txt``
10. ``pip install -r requirements/win.txt`` # Windows only!
11. ``$WINPTY python manage.py syncdb``
12. ``$WINPTY python manage.py migrate``
13. ``$WINPTY python manage.py collectstatic``
14. Open your qatrack/local\_settings.py file and add the line:
    ``ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']``
15. Restart the QATrack+ app (i.e. the CherryPy service)

If when you load a page in QATrack+ you see an error you may need to
enable ``use_legacy_date_fields`` for the SQL Server driver. Open your
local\_settings.py file and add the ``OPTIONS`` section shown below:

::

    #!python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'sqlserver_ado',
            'NAME': '*******',        
            'USER': '********', 
            'PASSWORD': '******',
            'HOST': '******',  
            'PORT': '',  
            # Add this options section!
            'OPTIONS': {
                'use_legacy_date_fields': True
            }
        }
    }

General
~~~~~~~

1. This last step only applies to those of you who have composite tests
   that rely on the current value of a multiple choice test. Since this
   update `changes the way multiple choice values are
   stored <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/issues/162/adding-new-multiple-choice-options-can>`__
   you need to update the calculation procedures for these tests. For
   example if your calculation procedure currently looks like this:

   ::

       test = Test.objects.get(name="Dosemeter")
       choices = test.choices.split(",")
       choice_idx = choices.index(dosemeter)

       previous_results = TestInstance.objects.filter(
           unit_test_info__test__slug="your_test_macro_name",
           value = choice_idx,
       ).latest("work_completed")

   you will need to modify it slightly like so:

   ::

       previous_results = TestInstance.objects.filter(
           unit_test_info__test__slug="your_test_macro_name",
           string_value = dosemeter,
       ).latest("work_completed")
