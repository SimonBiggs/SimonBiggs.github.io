QATrack+ Local Settings
=======================

Local settings allow you to override the default QATrack+ settings to
better meet your clinics needs. The most important settings are
explained below.

These settings should be defined in a ``local_settings.py`` file in the
main directory (same directory as ``settings.py``)

DEBUG Setting
-------------

When deploying your site for clinical use, you should set:

::

    DEBUG = False
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

however, when you are experiencing issues getting your site deployed,
setting:

::

    DEBUG = True
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

will show you a detailed error traceback which can be used to diagnose
any issues.

Allowed Host Setting
--------------------

If you are behind a hospital firewall you can set the ``ALLOWED_HOSTS``
setting to:

::

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']

otherwise you need to set allowed hosts either to your server name or IP
address (e.g. for Apache):

::

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['52.123.4.9']

or if you are running QATrack+ behind a reverse proxy (e.g. using IIS &
CherryPy):

::

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1']

Email Settings
--------------

See the `email settings page <email_settings.html>`__ for details.

Admin Email
-----------

Who should be emailed when internal QATrack+ errors occur:

::

    ADMINS = (
        ('Admin Name', 'admin.email@yourplace.com'),
    )
    MANAGERS = ADMINS

Cache Settings
--------------

By default QATrack+ stores cached pages and values on disk in the
directory ``qatrack/cache/cache_data/`` but this can be changed by
copying the Python dictionary below into your ``local_settings.py``
file:

::

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache',
            'LOCATION': '/path/to/your/desired/cache/data/location/',
            'TIMEOUT': 24*60*60, # cache timeout of 24hours
        }
    }

Generally you shouldn't need to change this unless you have concerns
about disk usage.

Time Zone Settings
------------------

By default QATrack+ is configured to use North American Eastern Standard
Time so you will need to adjust this to reflect your local time zone.

In your *local\_settings.py* file add a line like the following:

::

    TIME_ZONE = 'America/Toronto'

where 'America/Toronto' is replaced with your local timezone (e.g.
``TIME_ZONE = 'Australia/Sydney'``. If you are unsure, you can find a
list of `valid timezones on
Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>`__.

Icon Settings
-------------

By default QATrack+ will show icons to indicate the pass/fail or
due/overdue/not due status of tests and test lists.

Examples of the icons can be seen on
`BitBucket <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/pull-request/11/add-icons-to-reduce-dependence-on-red/diff>`__

To override the default settings, copy the following Python dictionary
to your ``local_settings.py`` file and change the relevant setting to
True/False.

::

    ICON_SETTINGS = {
        'SHOW_STATUS_ICONS_PERFORM':  True,
        'SHOW_STATUS_ICONS_LISTING':  True,
        'SHOW_STATUS_ICONS_REVIEW':  True,
        'SHOW_STATUS_ICONS_HISTORY':  False,
        'SHOW_REVIEW_ICONS':  True,
        'SHOW_DUE_ICONS':  True,
    }

-  ``SHOW_STATUS_ICONS_PERFORM`` controls whether the icons are shown
   when a user is performing a test list.
-  ``SHOW_STATUS_ICONS_LISTING`` controls whether icons are shown on
   listings pages which show the results of the last QA session.
   (Default True)
-  ``SHOW STATUS_ICONS_REVIEW`` controls whether the icons are shown
   when a user is reviewing a test list. (Default True)
-  ``SHOW STATUS_ICONS_HISTORY`` controls whether the icons are shown
   for historical results when a user is performing or reviewing a test
   list. (Default False)
-  ``SHOW_REVIEW_ICONS`` control whether to show warning icon for
   unreviewed test lists. (Default True)
-  ``SHOW_DUE_ICONS`` control whether to show icons for the due status
   of test lists. (Default True)

Tolerance Naming Settings
-------------------------

By changing the following settings you can alter the phrasing that
QATrack+ uses for indicating whether a test is passing/failing. The
``TEST_STATUS_DISPLAY_SHORT`` settings are used when performing a test
list and the ``TEST_STATUS_DISPLAY`` settings are used in notifications
and when displaying historical results.

::

    TEST_STATUS_DISPLAY = {
        'action': "Action",
        'fail': "Fail",
        'not_done': "Not Done",
        'done': "Done",
        'ok': "OK",
        'tolerance': "Tolerance",
        'no_tol': "No Tol Set",
    }

    TEST_STATUS_DISPLAY_SHORT = {
        'action': "ACT",
        'fail': "Fail",
        'not_done': "Not Done",
        'done': "Done",
        'ok': "OK",
        'tolerance': "TOL",
        'no_tol': "NO TOL",
    }

The meaning of the individual keys is as follows:

-  ``action``: Test is failing or at action level (shown to users with
   permission to view Refs/Tols)
-  ``fail``: Test is failing or at action level (shown to users without
   permission to view Refs/Tols)
-  ``not_done``: Test was not completed
-  ``done``: Test was completed
-  ``ok``: Test is passing / within tolerance
-  ``tolerance``: The test is at tolerance (shown to users with
   permission to view Refs/Tols)
-  ``no_tol``: No tolerances set for this test

Other Settings
--------------

AUTO\_REVIEW\_DEFAULT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set ``AUTO_REVIEW_DEFAULT = True`` in your ``local_settings.py`` file in
order to enable `Auto Review <../admin/auto_review.html>`__ by default.

DEFAULT\_WARNING\_MESSAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set ``DEFAULT_WARNING_MESSAGE = "Your custom message"`` to change the
default warning message that will be shown when a performed test is at
action level. If ``DEFAULT_WARNING_MESSAGE = ""`` then the default will
be to not show any warning message when a test is at action level.

ORDER\_UNITS\_BY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set ``ORDER_UNITS_BY = 'name'`` in your ``local_settings.py`` file in
order to order units by ``name`` rather than ``number``

REVIEW\_DIFF\_COL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set ``REVIEW_DIFF_COL = True`` to include a difference column when
reviewing test list results. This column shows the difference between a
test value and its reference value.
