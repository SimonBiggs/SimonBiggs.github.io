Deploying QATrack+ with Linux Apache & PostgreSQL
=================================================

This guide is going to walk you through installing QATrack+ on an Ubuntu
14.04 server with Python 2.7, Apache 2.4 as the web server and
PostgreSQL 9.3 (MySQL 5.5) as the database. Installation instructions
should be similar on other Linux systems.

The steps we will be undertaking are:

1. Installing and configuring git
2. Checkout the latest release of the QATrack+ source code from
   bitbucket.
3. Setting up our Python environment (including virtualenv)
4. Making sure everything is working up to this point
5. Installing Apache web server and mod\_wsgi and then configuring it to
   serve our QATrack+ site.
6. Installing the PostgreSQL (or MySQL) database server and setting up a
   database for QATrack+
7. Final configuration of QATrack+

This guide assumes you have at least a basic level of familiarity with
Linux and the command line.

1. Installing git
-----------------

Git is the version control software that QATrack+ uses. To install git
on Ubuntu run the following command:

::

    #!bash

    randlet@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install git

Next setup your git installation:

::

    #!bash
    git config --global user.name "randlet"
    git config --global user.email randle.taylor@gmail.com

2. Checking out the QATrack+ source code
----------------------------------------

Now that we have git installed we can proceed to grab the latest version
of QATrack+. To checkout the code enter the following commands:

::

    #!bash

    randlet@ubuntu:~$ mkdir ~/web
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~$ cd ~/web
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus.git
    Cloning into 'qatrackplus'...
    remote: Counting objects: 6897, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2042/2042), done.
    remote: Total 6897 (delta 4895), reused 6605 (delta 4705)
    Receiving objects: 100% (6897/6897), 2.07 MiB, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (4895/4895), done.
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web$

3. Setting up our python environment
------------------------------------

This tutorial is going to make use of
`virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`__ which allows you
to easily manage multiple Python environments on a single server. This
is not strictly required but is considered a best practice in the Python
world.

To install virtualenv:

::

    #!bash

    randlet@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    randlet@ubuntu:~$ sudo easy_install pip
    randlet@ubuntu:~$ sudo pip install virtualenv

Now that we have virtualenv installed we will create a new Python
environment for QATrack+.

::

    #!bash

    randlet@ubuntu:~$ mkdir ~/venvs
    randlet@ubuntu:~$ virtualenv ~/venvs/qatrack

To activate our new environment:

::

    #!bash

    randlet@ubuntu:~$ source ~/venvs/qatrack/bin/activate
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~$ which python
    /home/randlet/venvs/qatrack/bin/python
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~$

Change back to the location where we checked out the source code:

::

    #!bash

    randlet@ubuntu:~$ cd ~/web/qatrackplus

In that directory there is a directory with text files
(requirements/base.txt, requirements/optional.txt) that list the
required Python packages for QATrack+. A little prep work is required to
get them to install correctly. Enter the following commands to install
the preliminary libraries:

::

    #!bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran
    sudo apt-get install python-dev
    sudo apt-get install libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev liblapack-dev
    sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
    sudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib

After you install all the required libs:

::

    #!bash
    pip install -r requirements/base.txt
    pip install -r requirements/optional.txt

4. Making sure everything is working so far
-------------------------------------------

Before we move on to installing a proper web server and database we will
pause to make sure everything is working correctly at this point.

From the main qatrack directory enter the following commands

::

    #!bash

    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ mkdir db
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py syncdb

When running syncdb you will be asked if you want to create a superuser.
Answer yes and then enter a username and password.

Once that has finished running enter the following command:

::

    #!bash

    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py migrate

You should now have temporary sqlite database that can be used to verify
our setup has been going well. Next we will start the builtin (for
testing purposes) webserver and see if we can access our site/

::

    #!bash

    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    Validating  models...

    0 errors found
    Django version 1.6.11, using settings 'qatrack.settings'
    Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

If you now go to eg. XX.XXX.XXX.X:8000 (replace X's with your servers IP
address!) in a browser you should be redirected to a QATrack+ login
page.

After you have confirmed you can view the site, quit the server by
hitting CTRL-C.

    Note: depending on your setup, you may need to modify your firewall
    and use runserver something like the following:

    ::

        (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py runserver MYSERVERNAME:8000

    For example, I am using an Amazon EC2 instance for this tutorial, so
    I had to open port 8000 in the firewall and use the following
    runserver command:

    ::

        (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py runserver ec2-54-242-252-245.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000
        Validating models...

        0 errors found
        Django version 1.6, using settings 'qatrack.settings'
        Development server is running at http://ec2-54-242-252-245.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/

5. Installing Apache & mod\_wsgi
--------------------------------

The next step to take is to install and configure the Apache web server.
Apache and mod\_wsgi can be installed with the following commands:

::

    #!bash

    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi

Next we can setup Apache to serve our Django site.

Copy the file apache24.conf from the qatrackplus/deploy directory to the
Apache config directory:

::

    #!bash

    If you want to host QATrack+ somewhere other than the root of your
    server (e.g. you want to host the QATrack+ application at
    http://myserver/qatrackplus/), Please see the appendix below.

Then remove any default sites and link your qatrack site conf file in
the sites-enabled directory:

::

    #!bash

    sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    sudo cp ~/web/qatrackplus/deploy/apache24.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/qatrack.conf
    sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/qatrack.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/qatrack.conf
    # now edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/qatrack.conf and set the correct file paths
    sudo service apache2 restart

Now copy the file ~/web/qatrackplus/deploy/wsgi.py to qatrack/
directory:

::

    #!bash

    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ cp deploy/wsgi.py qatrack/wsgi.py

And then edit qatrack/wsgi.py so it looks like the following (again
making sure the paths are appropriate for your setup)

::

    #!python

    import os
    import sys

    sys.path.append('/home/randlet/web/qatrackplus')

    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "qatrack.settings")

    # This application object is used by any WSGI server configured to use this
    # file. This includes Django's development server, if the WSGI_APPLICATION
    # setting points here.
    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    application = get_wsgi_application()

Now restart apache:

::

    #!bash
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ sudo service apache2 restart
     * Restarting web server apache2
     ... waiting ..........   ...done.

If you visit your site again in the browser you should see the QATrack+
login page or a yellow OperationalError page. (The error page is fine,
it just means the path to the temporary database is not correct but
Apache is working correctly.)

If you get an internal server error or the site doesn't appear to load,
check the Apache error log files for more information (default location
is /var/log/apache2/error.log).

6. Setting up a database
------------------------

If Apache is working correctly at this point, we can move on and set up
a database. The official Django recommendation is PostgreSQL but MySQL
will work fine as well. Choose whichever one you are more comfortable
with.

PostgreSQL (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install PostgreSQL and the Python adapter:

::

    #!bash

    sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev
    pip install psycopg2

Now we can create and configure a user and database for QATrack+:

::

    #!bash

    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ sudo -u postgres psql template1
    psql (9.3.14)
    Type "help" for help.

    template1=# ALTER USER postgres with encrypted password 'your_pg_password';
    ALTER ROLE
    template1=# CREATE DATABASE qatrackdb;
    CREATE DATABASE
    template1=# CREATE USER qatrack with PASSWORD 'qatrackpass';
    CREATE ROLE
    template1=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE qatrackdb to qatrack;
    GRANT
    template1=\q#

Now edit /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg\_hba.conf and scroll down to the
bottom and change the two instances of ``peer`` to `.html5`` so it looks
like:

::

    #!bash

    # Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
    local   all             postgres                               .html5

    # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

    # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
    local   all             all                                    .html5
    # IPv4 local connections:
    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32           .html5
    # IPv6 local connections:
    host    all             all             ::1/128                .html5

and restart the pg server:

::

    #!bash
    sudo service postgresql restart

MySQL (Postgres alternative)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install MySQL and the Python adapter:

::

    #!bash

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
    pip install mysql-python

Now we can create and configure a user and database for QATrack+:

::

    #!bash
    mysql -u root -p

and then enter the following commands in the MySQL shell:

::

    #!bash
    CREATE DATABASE qatrackdb;
    GRANT ALL ON qatrackdb.* TO 'qatrack'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'qatrackpass';
    quit

7. Final config of QATrack+
---------------------------

Next (we're almost done, I promise!) we need to tell QATrack+ how to
connect to our database.

Create a file called local\_settings.py in ~/web/qatrackplus/qatrack/
and put the following Python code in it (choose the correct engine -
postgreqal\_psycopg2 or mysql):

::

    #!python

    DEBUG = False
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
            'NAME': 'qatrackdb',                      # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
            'USER': 'qatrack',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
            'PASSWORD': 'qatrackpass',                  # Not used with sqlite3.
            'HOST': '',                      # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
            'PORT': '',                      # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.
        }
    }


    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['XX.XXX.XXX.XX']  # Set to your server IP address!

For details of what the ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` setting should be, please see
`the local\_settings.py page <../settings.html>`__.

And then create the tables in your database via sycndb/migrate

::

    #!bash
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py syncdb
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py migrate
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py loaddata fixtures/defaults/*/*

We also need to collect all our static files in a single location for
Apache to serve (answer 'yes' when asked)

::

    #!bash

    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ python manage.py collectstatic

and finally restart Apache one more time.

::

    #!bash
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ sudo service apache2 restart

8. Final word

Appendix 1: Configuration for hosting at a non root url

If you want to host QATrack+ somewhere other than the root of your
server (e.g. you want to host the QATrack+ application at
http://myserver/qatrackplus/), you will need to ensure mod\_rewrite is
enabled:

::

    #!bash
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ sudo a2enmod rewrite
    (qatrack)randlet@ubuntu:~/web/qatrackplus$ sudo service apache2 restart

and you will need to include the following lines in your
qatrack/local\_settings.py file

::

    #!python

    FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = "/qatrackplus"
    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "/qatrackplus/qa/unit/"
    LOGIN_URL = "/qatrackplus/accounts/login/"

and use the apache24\_non\_root.conf config file available in the
``qatrackplus/deploy`` directory.

::

    #!bash

    sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    sudo cp ~/web/qatrackplus/deploy/apache24_non_root.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/qatrack.conf
    sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/qatrack.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/qatrack.conf
    # now edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/qatrack.conf and set the correct file paths
    sudo service apache2 restart
