Deploying QATrack+
==================

A note about security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before deploying QATrack+ in the clinic, please take the time to read
about security & QATrack+ on the `security notes page <security.html>`__.
We recommend using https for your site whenever possible.

Deployment Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django applications like QATrack+ are `typically deployed on a Linux
server using PostgreSQL or MySQL as the
database <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/>`__.
If your department has Linux support/experience this is the recommended
way to deploy QATrack+.

That said deploying to a Windows Server instance using SQL Server is
entirely feasible and many clinics choose this as their platform.

Deployment on a Mac server is also relatively straightforward.

Below you can find a number of guides for a variety of platforms. As of
version 0.2.9, only the first two here are tested officially by the
developers before release.

Officialy Supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Linux/Apache/PostgreSQL(or MySQL) <linux/lapp.html>`__ (recommended)
-  `Windows Server/IIS/CherryPy/SQL Server <windows/iis.html>`__ (TOHCC's
   current setup serving 2 campuses & 100+ users)

Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Windows Server/IIS/SQL Server <windows/iisFastCGI.html>`__ (Full MS
   implementation with SSO/Integrated Authentication)
-  `Windows Desktop/Apache/PostgreSQL <windows/wapp.html>`__ (Run QATrack+
   from a Windows desktop)
-  `OS X Server(ML)/Apache/PostgreSQL <osx/osxinstall.html>`__

Configuring QATrack+ for your needs
-----------------------------------

There are lots of settings in QATrack+ that can be tweaked to meet the
specific needs of your clinic. Some of the most common ones are
described below (in progress!). Generally the qatrack/settings.py file
should be left alone and any customizations for your clinic should be
placed in a qatrack/local\_settings.py file.

-  `Using Active Directory for User
   Authentication <active_directory.html>`__
-  `QATrack+ email settings <email_settings.html>`__
-  `QATrack+ local settings <settings.html>`__
-  `QATrack+ custom css rules <site_css.html>`__
