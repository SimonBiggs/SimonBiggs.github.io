Getting Started with QATrack+
-----------------------------

Since QATrack+ is a web application (i.e. a client/server configuration)
getting it installed and set up correctly is not as simple as running a
one-click installer: it will require a time investment and some
technical skills (however there is a single file download for evaluating
QATrack+ described below). The process will be different depending on
the specific requirements of your clinic and the platform (Operating
System/server software/database) you choose but to help you get started,
we are providing a number of tutorials on how to deploy QATrack+ on
various platforms. If you want some help deciding what platform to use
or need some help installing and configuring QATrack+, please post in
the `QATrack+ discussion group/mailing
list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/qatrack>`__ and
I will be happy to help out however I can!

Evaluating QATrack+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to take QATrack+ for a test drive and have access to a
Windows computer, the easiest path is to `download the latest
version <https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/downloads>`__ of
the standalone QATrack+ program. Simply download a file, unzip it
somewhere and run the *qatrackplus.bat* file. This will start a simple
web server with an embedded database and allow you to try out QATrack+
on your desktop. More details are available in the README.txt file
included with that download.

This standalone version should be used for testing and getting a feel
for the latest version of QATrack+. Due to limitations in its database
and webserver, **the standalone version is not meant to be used in
situations where multiple users will be accessing it at the same time**
(i.e. most clinical settings).

Implementing QATrack+ in the Clinic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have decided that you would like to use QATrack+ the first
thing to do is `join the QATrack+ discussion
group <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/qatrack>`__!
Obviously this isn't mandatory, but it is your best avenue for getting
implementation advice, help with configuration, discussing new features
etc. Plus, we would love to hear where QATrack+ is being used!

Deploying QATrack+

Since QATrack+ can be deployed on multiple OS's (Windows/Linux/Mac) with
multiple different databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL) you
should first determine (in consultation with your IT department if
appropriate ) what the most appropriate platform for running QATrack+ in
your clinic is.

The recommended platform for running QATrack+ is using a Linux server
with PostgreSQL as a database. That said, you are certainly free to
choose another platform that either you or your IT department are more
comfortable with. In fact, due to the hospitals IT infrastructure, at
The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, we use a Microsoft based stack based
on Windows Server 2008 & MS SQL Server.

A number of installation & deployment guides are currently being worked
on and you can find them on our `deployment
page <v/0.2.9/deployment/about.html>`__.

Contributing to QATrack+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We would love to have people from outside TOHCC contributing to the
