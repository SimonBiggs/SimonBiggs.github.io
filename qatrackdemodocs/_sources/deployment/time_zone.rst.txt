QATrack+ time zone settings
===========================

By default QATrack+ is configured to use North American Eastern Standard
Time so you will need to adjust this to reflect your local time zone.

In your *local\_settings.py* file add a line like the following:

::

    TIME_ZONE = 'America/Toronto'

where 'America/Toronto' is replaced with your local timezone (e.g.
``TIME_ZONE = 'Australia/Sydney'``. If you are unsure, you can find a
list of `valid timezones on
Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>`__.
