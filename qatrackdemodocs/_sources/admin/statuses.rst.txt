Configuring Test Statuses
=========================

Every test instance that is created has a status assigned to it (and
hence there must be at least one status defined before doing QA).

These statuses allow you to flag tests for review, indicate whether a
test result is valid or not and whether or not a test result should be
included in charts by default.

An example status definition is shown here with the various fields
explained below.

   Status overview

-  The status **Name** is what will be displayed on pages where this
   status is used, the **Slug** is a `url safe version of the
   name <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug>`__ and the
   **Description** should be a brief description of when a test should
   be given this status.

-  If **Is default** is checked for a status then all new test instances
   created when a user performs a test list will be given this status
   unless explicitly overridden by the user.

-  If a test instance has a status with **Requires review** checked its
   parent test list instance will appear in the `**Unreviewed**
   queue <../users/review_qa_data.html>`__.

-  **Export by default** indicates whether test instances with this
   status should be included by default in data plots. In the figure
   below the *Rejected* status does not have **Export by default**
   checked and therefore must be specifically checked off if they want
   to include *Rejected* data in the plots.

-  **Valid** indicates whether tests with this status are "good" data or
   not (i.e. if the test was carried out correctly).
