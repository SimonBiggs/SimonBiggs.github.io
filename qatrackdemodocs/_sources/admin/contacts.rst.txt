Adding Contacts
===============

When performing a test list, at the top right hand corner there is a
contact numbers box that can be used to list useful phone numbers in
case the person performing QA needs assistance. At The Ottawa Hospital
Clinic this feature would often be used by Therapists to call a
Physicist for assistance.

To create a new contact number click on the **Contacts** link on the
main admin page and then **Add contact** at the top right hand corner.

On the next page fill out the display name, phone number and a short
description of what this number is used for. The description will be
displayed when a users hovers the mouse over the number when performing
QA.

Here are three defined contact numbers in the admin:
