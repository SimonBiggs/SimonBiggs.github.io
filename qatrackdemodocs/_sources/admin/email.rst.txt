Email notifications
===================

QATrack+ can be configured so that when a test list is performed and has
tests which are at tolerance or failing an email can be sent to specific
`groups <auth.html>`__. This requires that your website administrator has
configured the `email settings <../deployment/email_settings.html>`__
correctly.

To create a new notification, choose the **Notification subscriptions**
option under the **Notifications** section on the main admin page and
then click on **Add notification subscription** in the top right hand
corner of the page.

Choose the group who you want to receive emails and choose whether the
emails should be sent only when tests are failing or both when tests are
at tolerance or failing. Click **Save** when you are finished.
