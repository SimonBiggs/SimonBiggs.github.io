QATrack+ Administrators Guide
=============================

*The admin guide is intended for use by anyone who will be responsible
for configuring tests and test lists, modifying references & tolerances
or managing users and user permissions.*

To access the admin site, log into QATrack+ and then choose the
**Admin** option from the dropdown at the top right hand corner of the
page (where your username is displayed).

A walk through tutorial (with screenshots) on going from a blank
QATrack+ install to a fully configured, performable test list is
available on the `tutorials page <tutorials/tutorials.html>`__. Reading
through this tutorial is a great way to familiarize yourself with
QATrack+ configuration.

Initial Configuration
---------------------

Before you start defining tests and test lists for the first time it is
a good idea to begin by doing some initial configuration.

1. `Change the name of your website <change_site_name.html>`__
2. `Create at least one Unit <units.html>`__
3. `Define some user groups <auth.html>`__
4. `Create a couple of test statuses <statuses.html>`__
5. `Create some test categories <categories.html>`__
6. `Set up some test frequencies <frequencies.html>`__
